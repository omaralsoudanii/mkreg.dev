## Introduction

This article is not about something specific, this is just a list of commands for various Linux programs and tools, some might be simple, others useless. Some might be great, so to clarify this list is what **I** find useful for **me**, you can look through it and who knows? maybe you'll like some of it

> The list will be incrementally changed, could be daily or maybe once a month. Every time I find something interesting or new that I actually use whether it's for a new program or a just a new command, Adding it here doesn't make sense, I'll think of a way to split each topic, maybe with a new layout for better UI/UX.

## General

### Find out how many lines a file contains a phrase

```bash
cat /var/log/app.log.2 | grep "api/users" | wc -l
```

### Curl request details

Curl a request with form-data uploading a file using and get some speed info

```bash:HTTP2
curl -w '\nEstablish Connection: %{time_connect}s \ 
	\nTTFB: %{time_starttransfer}s\n  \
	Total: %{time_total}s\nUpload speed: %{speed_upload}s\n' --http2  \
	--location --request POST 'https://www.somedomain.com/uploadfile' \
	--header 'Authorization: Bearer HwzQAS323DvAGQ23123' \
	--form 'file=@/home/some_file.csv' \
	--form 'file=@/home/another_file.csv'
```

This specific thing is important due to the nature of how **HTTP2** works, uploading files could be slower unless you tune your web-server **HTTP2** initial window. Try it with **HTTP1.1** and see the difference

```bash:HTTP1.1
curl -w '\nEstablish Connection: %{time_connect}s \
	\nTTFB: %{time_starttransfer}s\n \
	Total: %{time_total}s\nUpload speed: %{speed_upload}s\n' --http1.1 \
	--location --request POST 'https://www.somedomain.com/uploadfile' \
	--header 'Authorization: Bearer HwzQAS323DvAGQ23123' \ 
	--form 'file=@/home/some_file.csv' \
	--form 'file=@/home/another_file.csv'
```

You can refer to the write out command in Curl (You can find it Nuggets section too)

### Network speed test

Check network speed of the host you are in, this is very useful to get actual results about the bandwidth of say your VPS server or your home setup.


```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py | python -
```


### Disk usage

Check hard drives disk usage size on your machine, or the host you logged into.

The whole drive

```bash
df -h
```

The current directory

```bash
du -sh *
```

### Tailing logs

tail all incoming new lines for log file(s)

```bash
tail -f -n0 *-error_logs.log
```

### Find file(s)

Find if file(s) exists in the current directory/sub-directories, and list found file(s) locations

**Note:** This needs **sudo** to look in directories that requires root permission, it will also list of all files and directories in the current directory if it finds nothing, I will look into it and fix later.

```bash
find . -name "*-logs.json" | xargs ls -lh
```

### process(es) details
Find if process(es) are currently running, and list process(es) details (root process/child processes) if found


```bash
ps aux | grep mysql
```

### manage service(es) with different users

```bash
sudo -u www-data service nginx start
sudo -u omar service netdata restart
```

## Docker

### Docker compose

This builds the images and run their containers assuming the default compose file name is docker-compose.yml, or by specifying it's file name.

Default file name

```bash
docker-compose up  --build -d
```
Different file name

```bash
docker-compose  -f docker-compose.development.yml up  --build -d
```

Build images and run their containers while ignoring the current existing images cache (useful for multi-stage builds, when you just want to re-build everything with fresh layers)

```bash
docker-compose build  --no-cache
```
### exec command

This executes a command from a container

```bash
docker exec -it node_app npm install
```

### Exporting MySQL database

Export data from a Docker MySQL container to a directory using `mysqldump` and execute command

-    Full database structure and data
     
        ```bash
        docker exec -i app_mysql-server-57_1 mysqldump \ 
        -uroot -proot --databases mydb_name --skip-comments > /Documents/db.sql
        ```
-    Specified table structure and data 
     
        ```bash
        docker exec -i app_mysql-server-57_1 mysqldump \ 
        -uroot -proot mydb_name mytable_name > /Documents/db.sql
        ```
-    Specific table structure and data that matches a where clause
     
        ```bash
        docker exec app_mysql mysqldump \ 
        -uroot -proot mydb_name --tables mytable_name --where="id>5 limit 5000000" > mytable_name.sql
        ```



### SSH into a container

-    For alpine images, only sh is available 
     
        ```bash
        docker exec -it app_server sh
        ```
-    For other images,  bash is available
     
        ```bash
        docker exec -it app_server bash
        ```

### Testing config

Preview and validate a docker compose file configuration found in the specified path


```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml config
```

### Deleting data

Delete all stopped containers and unused images/networks/volumes and non persistent volumes and their networks

**WARNING:** Beware that all stopped containers, and unused images/networks/volumes will be deleted, so if you have something stopped but want to use it later, or you want the image cache layers, then don't do this.

```bash:Everything
docker system prune -a
```
<br/>

```bash:Networks
docker network prune
```

<br/>

```bash:Volumes
docker volume ls -qf dangling=true | xargs -r docker volume rm
```

### Tailing logs

This gets you the latest 100 line from a container

```bash
docker logs --tail 100 -f app_server
```

This finds lines that contains a phrase and print the containing line, 3 lines before it and 3 lines after it

```bash
docker logs -f --tail 10000  app_server | grep -B3 -A3 "api/users"
```

### System wide info

```bash
docker system info
```

### Disk usage

```bash:Detailed
docker system df -v
```

<br/>


```bash:Overview
docker system df
```

## MySQL

### Exporting data

Export MySQL database to a directory with `mysqldump`

-    Full database structure and data 
     
        ```bash
        mysqldump -uroot -proot --databases mydb_name \ 
        --skip-comments > /Documents/db.sql
        ```
-    Specified table structure and data 
     
        ```bash
        mysqldump -uroot -proot mydb_name mytable_name > /Documents/db.sql
        ```
-    A specific table structure and data that matches a where clause
     
        ```bash
        mysqldump -uroot -proot mydb_name --tables mytable_name \ 
        --where="id>5 limit 5000000" > mytable_name.sql
        ```

### Changing CLI pager 

 This Changes MySQL CLI pager to `less`. Using `less` helps readability when viewing large sets of data from queries in the terminal. Use this after you login into MySQL shell

```bash
pager less -R -S
```

### Using Profiling

In your current MySQL session you can enable profiling to debug and tune queries performance

```sql
SET profiling = 1;
select * from table_name where field_name like '%omar%';
SHOW PROFILES;
SHOW PROFILE FOR QUERY 1; ## 1 is the ID from SHOW PROFILES
SHOW PROFILE CPU FOR QUERY 2;
```

## MongoDB

![Omar Alsoudani - MongoDB](/static/images/writing/linux-bin-bash/linux-bash-mongodb-mkreg.jpg)

### All databases

```js
show dbs
```

### Select a database

```js
use mydb_name
```

### All collections for a database

```js
show collections
```

### Create a new collection for a database

```js
db.createCollection("collection_name")
```

### All indexes for a collection

```js
db.collection_name.getIndexes()
```

### New Index
This creates a new index on a field in a collection for a selected database

```js
db.collection_name.createIndex({field_name:1})
```

### Dropping Index
This drops a new index on a field in a collection for a selected database

```js
db.collection_name.dropIndex({field_name:1})
```

## PHP

![Omar Alsoudani - PHP](/static/images/writing/linux-bin-bash/linux-bash-php-mkreg.png)

### Running scripts
Run a script using specific PHP version, and passing environment variables to the script

```bash
WEBSITE=www.reddit.com ENVIROMENT=development  /usr/bin/php7.4 -f /var/www/swoole/server.php 
```

### Managing modules

Enable/Disable PHP modules for a specific PHP version (needs root permission)

```bash:Enable
sudo phpenmod -v 7.4 xdebug
```
<br/>
     
```bash:Disable
sudo phpdismod -v 7.4 curl
```

### Checking settings
Check the PHP settings of your installed version

```bash
php -i
php -i | grep "error_reporting"
```

In case you are using multiple PHP versions on the same machine, use ```which php``` and ```php -v``` to find the used version and its binary location
