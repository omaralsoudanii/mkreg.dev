## Introduction

My collection of technologies and tools, the list grown over the past couple of years, some I consider my self well-versed 

The rest I'm capable enough to be up and running in short time – this depends on what I’m currently using, usually when you stop using a software tool, you would need some time to catch up with the ecosystem and changes to that tool.

> Naturally this page will be updated with new technologies that I’ll use

## Programming languages

When I thought about what programming languages I’ve actually used, it boiled down to the list below – saying “used”  doesn’t imply I’ve used it for a project at my workplace.

It means that I can work on a project that uses any of the below (assuming I might be rusty on some, so I’ll need a couple of weeks (less maybe? who knows!) – it doesn’t matter where and why I’ve used it.

- [JavaScript](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ChnulxvW0AEUs1J?format=jpg&name=large) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  
- [Golang](https://golang.org/)
  
- [Java](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  
- [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/)
  
- [PHP](https://i.imgur.com/VgqoCKW.png)

## Databases

You could debate that some of these are not databases, which is kinda correct for some of those – however all of them deals with storage one way or another, I can even say they all part of the Infrastructure (see below) but this seemed more suitable – my usage for those could differ as well.

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) & [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [Memcached](https://memcached.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

## Infrastructure

These tools are the core parts of building software – choosing the right tool probably have higher impact than deciding if you want MySQL or MariaDB (to a certain degree…).

- [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/)
- [NGINX](https://nginx.org/)
- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- Cloud providers with self managed servers (we give you a server, you build and maintain the software) – only **Linux** distributions (**Debian** & **RHEL** based)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)
- [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack/) – ElasticSearch stack for Observability
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
- [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb/) & [Telegraf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/)
- [0MQ](https://zeromq.org/)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- [Podman](https://podman.io/)

## Tools

Helps me work faster, produce more accurate results – tools that serve one purpose while maintaining reliability.

- [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/)
- [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) – why this is here not Infrastructure? Good question! and mostly because I use it for testing or some random project I’m working on for absolutely no reason, visit this page in 4 years maybe I would have it figured out. 
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/)
- [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta)
- [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/)
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
- [Update Golang](https://github.com/udhos/update-golang) Upgrading Golang version is probably the most annoying thing about the language. This is a script that upgrade and fetch the latest Golang version (stable ones)
- Recently I started using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as a reminder and calendar for what's next!

## Stuff for developing

I made this list, just to criticize some tools in a passive aggressive manner.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) As the main editor, [Vim](https://github.com/omaralsoudanii/vimrc/) when I can – config is a fork from [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc/) with some minor tweaks, sometimes I use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) when I wanna work on a language – Uhm… actually I'll let that up to you to guess which language (runs on 20 bazillion devices).

   

  And it forces you to be vendor-locked to a specific **IDE** that decides to reserve 20GB of RAM while editing a small program. Nah IDEA is amazing, it’s just my computer.. or the 2000 line function that someone wrote 🤔

- Whatever Terminal comes with the distro I have. Currently **GNOME** Terminal with customized colors using [terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy), however when I had **KDE** I loved the simplicity of **Konsole**.

- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/)

- [Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/)

- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) for coding stuff, [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) for reading.

- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) with the old design, I'll just stop visiting if they remove it. Browsing those sites is a sign that I have some chore work to do, or stuck on something stupid.

- [The Sultan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiYs0vL7tkkCK4yF_YhfyEQ/playlists) 24/7 on shuffle mode.

- [GitHub mobile](https://github.com/mobile) Lately I've been enjoying GitHub on mobile (Android) when I'm just bored. I browse the explore tab and check new stuff, sometimes I find something I'm interested in using.

## Workstation

An ancient desktop PC that you don't even wanna know about (Yes I do whine when Electron eats my RAM for lunch).

It's not that bad, here's the specs according to **neofetch**:

- M.2 NVMe SSD.
- 32 GB RAM – I guess it's 2400MHz, but the BIOS wants to run it on 2100MHz.
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070. Hold your thoughts, this is running on [Linux](/static/images/writing/stack/linus-torvalds-middle-finger.jpg) OS.
- Intel I7-6700 (8) @ 4.000GHz, not sure what the hell this CPU generation is from, but I know it's old and probably the bottle neck (and the bloated software we use daily – with the addition of Spectre patch…).
- Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS – stable and nothing to complain about, hence I hate it.
- The worst screen ever created, the all mighty **ASUS VG248QE**
- A motherboard.
