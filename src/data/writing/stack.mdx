## Introduction

My collection of technologies and tools from programming languages to editors. Most of these have grown over the years I've started programming, some of them I consider my self well-versed, others I'm capable enough to be up and running in short time. 

> Naturally this page will be updated frequently with the latest tech and tools

## Coding

- [JavaScript](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ChnulxvW0AEUs1J?format=jpg&name=large) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  
- [Golang](https://golang.org/)
  
- [Java](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  
- [C#](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/)
  
- [PHP](https://i.imgur.com/VgqoCKW.png)

## Databases

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) & [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
  
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
  
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/) & [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack)
  
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
  
- [Memcached](https://memcached.org/)
  
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
  
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)

## Infrastructure

- [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/)
- [NGINX](https://nginx.org/)
- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Podman](https://podman.io/)
- [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/)
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) **EC2**, **S3** & **Cloudfront**
- [0MQ](https://zeromq.org/)
- [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)
- Bare metal cloud providers, only **Linux** distros (**Debian** & **RHEL** based)

## Tools

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
- [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/)
- [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/)
- [Vegeta](https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta)
- [Brave Browser](https://brave.com/)
- [Update Golang](https://github.com/udhos/update-golang) Upgrading Golang version is probably the most annoying thing about the language. This is a script that upgrade and fetch the latest Golang version (stable ones)
- Recently I started using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as a reminder and calendar for what's next!

## Stuff for developing

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) As the main editor. [Vim](https://github.com/omaralsoudanii/vimrc/) when I can, config is a fork from [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc/) with minor tweaks like deleting plugins I don't need and  some theme adjustments. 

  Sometimes I use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) when I wanna work on a language, actually I'll let that up to you to guess WHAT language is locked to using an **IDE** that decides to reserve 20GB of RAM while editing a small program.

- Whatever Terminal comes with the distro I have. Currently **GNOME** Terminal with customized colors using [terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy), however when I had **KDE** I loved the simplicity of **Konsole**.

- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/)

- [Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/)

- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) for coding stuff, [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) for reading

- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) with the old design, I'll just stop visiting if they remove it. Browsing those sites is a sign that I have some chore work to do, or stuck on something stupid

- [The Sultan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiYs0vL7tkkCK4yF_YhfyEQ/playlists) 24/7 on shuffle mode

- [GitHub mobile](https://github.com/mobile) Lately I've been enjoying GitHub on mobile (Android) when I'm just bored. I browse the explore tab and check new stuff, sometimes I find something I'm interested in using.

## Workstation

An ancient desktop PC that you don't even wanna know about (Yes I do whine when Electron eats my RAM for lunch).

It's not that bad, here's the specs according to **neofetch**:

- M.2 NVMe SSD
- 40 GB RAM (I guess it's 2400MHz)
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070. Hold your thoughts, this is running on [Linux](/static/images/writing/stack/linus-torvalds-middle-finger.jpg) OS
- Intel I7-6700 (8) @ 4.000GHz. Not sure what the hell is this, but I know it's old and probably the bottle neck (and the bloated software we use daily)
- Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
- The worst screen ever created, the all mighty **ASUS VG248QE**
- A motherboard
