## Overview

This page covers Docker specific commands on Linux. You can use it as a reference in case you want to do some task quickly, or you might find something new and beneficial when using Docker.

### Docker compose

This builds the images and run their containers assuming the default compose file name is docker-compose.yml, or by specifying the file name.

#### Default file name

```bash
docker-compose up  --build -d
```

#### Different file name

```bash
docker-compose  -f docker-compose.development.yml up  --build -d
```

**More than one file.** This gives you the ability to add more than one file, and **docker will combine them into and single configuration**. Docker will build the configuration by the order of the files supplied, so subsequent files will add configuration or override (in case the configuration directive was in two files) to their predecessors

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.base.yml -f docker-compose.proxy.yml -f docker-compose.migration.yml up --build -d
```

Build images and run their containers **while ignoring the current existing images cache** (useful for multi-stage builds, when you just want to re-build everything with fresh layers)

```bash
docker-compose build  --no-cache
```

The same as above but this time also **attempt to pull the latest version of the images**. The pull argument might be useless for you if your images are pinned to an exact version. For example this NodeJS image `node:14.16.1-alpine` specifies the major, minor and patch with the tag alpine, so the pull argument will do nothing. Meanwhile this NodeJS image `node:alpine` will **attempt** to pull the latest non-breaking changes **LTS** version, basically it will update the minor and patch versions.

```bash
docker-compose build  --no-cache --pull
```

> Although I said non-breaking, you never know with docker. So I always prefer the pinning to exact version and update the image myself manually. Unless ofcourse I'm too lazy to do that, then I use the second method. Which is the case in this site!

### exec command

This executes a command from a container

```bash
docker exec -it node_app npm install
```

### Exporting MySQL database

Export data from a Docker MySQL container to a directory using `mysqldump` and execute command

- Full database structure and data

  ```bash
  docker exec -i app_mysql-server-57_1 mysqldump \
  -uroot -proot --databases mydb_name --skip-comments > /Documents/db.sql
  ```

- Specified table structure and data

  ```bash
  docker exec -i app_mysql-server-57_1 mysqldump \
  -uroot -proot mydb_name mytable_name > /Documents/db.sql
  ```

- Specific table structure and data that matches a where clause

  ```bash
  docker exec app_mysql mysqldump \
  -uroot -proot mydb_name --tables mytable_name --where="id>5 limit 5000000" > mytable_name.sql
  ```

### SSH into a container

- For **alpine** images, only sh is available

  ```bash
  docker exec -it app_server sh
  ```

- For **other** images, bash is available

  ```bash
  docker exec -it app_server bash
  ```

### Testing config

Preview and validate a docker compose file configuration found in the specified path

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.development.yml config
```

### Deleting data

Delete all stopped containers and unused images/networks/volumes and non persistent volumes and their networks

**WARNING:** Beware that all stopped containers, and unused images/networks/volumes will be deleted, so if you have something stopped but want to use it later, or you want the image cache layers, then don't do this.

```bash:Everything
docker system prune -a
```

```bash:Networks
docker network prune
```

```bash:Volumes
docker volume ls -qf dangling=true | xargs -r docker volume rm
```

**Note:** If you are using **volumes managed by docker** instead of bind volumes by declaring them in a docker-compose file. Beware that you might accidentally wipe the whole data by issuing the following

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

`down` tells docker to remove all containers and images from the running compose file. `-v` tells docker to also **wipe any managed volumes**

### Tailing logs

This gets you the latest 100 line from a container

```bash
docker logs --tail 100 -f app_server
```

This finds lines that contains a phrase and print the containing line, 3 lines before it and 3 lines after it

```bash
docker logs -f --tail 10000  app_server | grep -B3 -A3 "api/users"
```

### System wide info

```bash
docker system info
```

### Disk usage

```bash:Detailed
docker system df -v
```

```bash:Overview
docker system df
```
