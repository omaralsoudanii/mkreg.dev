## Overview

This page covers general commands using Linux. Not specific to any program, some could be used for debugging, others might be validating something or simply getting some info about a running process. 

## Commands

### Find out how many lines a file contains a phrase

```bash
cat /var/log/app.log.2 | grep "api/users" | wc -l
```

### Curl request details

Curl a request with form-data uploading a file using and get some speed info

```bash:HTTP2
curl -w '\nEstablish Connection: %{time_connect}s \ 
	\nTTFB: %{time_starttransfer}s\n  \
	Total: %{time_total}s\nUpload speed: %{speed_upload}s\n' --http2  \
	--location --request POST 'https://www.somedomain.com/uploadfile' \
	--header 'Authorization: Bearer HwzQAS323DvAGQ23123' \
	--form 'file=@/home/some_file.csv' \
	--form 'file=@/home/another_file.csv'
```

This specific thing is important due to the nature of how **HTTP2** works, uploading files could be slower unless you tune your web-server **HTTP2** initial window. Try it with **HTTP1.1** and see the difference

```bash:HTTP1.1
curl -w '\nEstablish Connection: %{time_connect}s \
	\nTTFB: %{time_starttransfer}s\n \
	Total: %{time_total}s\nUpload speed: %{speed_upload}s\n' --http1.1 \
	--location --request POST 'https://www.somedomain.com/uploadfile' \
	--header 'Authorization: Bearer HwzQAS323DvAGQ23123' \ 
	--form 'file=@/home/some_file.csv' \
	--form 'file=@/home/another_file.csv'
```

You can refer to the write out command in Curl (You can find it Nuggets section too)

### Network speed test

Check network speed of the host you are in, this is very useful to get actual results about the bandwidth of say your VPS server or your home setup.


```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sivel/speedtest-cli/master/speedtest.py | python -
```


### Disk usage

Check hard drives disk usage size on your machine, or the host you logged into.

The whole drive

```bash
df -h
```

The current directory

```bash
du -sh *
```

### Tailing logs

tail all incoming new lines for log file(s)

```bash
tail -f -n0 *-error_logs.log
```

### Find file(s)

Find if file(s) exists in the current directory/sub-directories, and list found file(s) locations

**Note:** This needs **sudo** to look in directories that requires root permission, it will also list of all files and directories in the current directory if it finds nothing, I will look into it and fix later.

```bash
find . -name "*-logs.json" | xargs ls -lh
```

### process(es) details

Find if process(es) are currently running, and list process(es) details (root process/child processes) if found


```bash
ps aux | grep mysql
```

### manage service(es) with different users

```bash
sudo -u www-data service nginx start
sudo -u omar service netdata restart
```
