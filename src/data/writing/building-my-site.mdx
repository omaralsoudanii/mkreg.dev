## The realization 

**Front-end** is harder and more complex than what most programmers who don't do any **UI/UX** stuff think. I was one of those until I actually had to build one.
This a high level talk about building and developing my personal site. Coding and infrastructure wise.


## The clueless research

No idea how I just decided to have my own personal site, guess I was bored and wanted to learn something not related to my specialty. 

I consider in-depth knowledge when building Front-end applications is valuable for someone who focuses on Back-end,   you gotta optimize delivery for the Front-end app after all, whether it's infrastructure based or code wise based.

I never worked on these new frameworks although I understand and know the concepts and how they work under the hood and I've watched a [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) about React like 4 years ago when everything was a class. 

So I started my research about the good stuff. Basically the end result was to decide between [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) or [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). 

I decided to go with  [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) since I knew **React** and **Next** seemed to be always ahead, used more and bigger sites were using it. 

To be fair it boiled down to the fact that **I just knew React syntax**, I don't have that much free time to learn another syntax, so you could say the whole research thing is baseless and the result is just a matter of personal preference.

## Technologies used

> This post will be updated from time to time as tech emerges and new tooling is used

- [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/)  HAProxy is not just a **"loadbalancer"**, it's the perfect combo with Cloudflare.

-  [~~NGINX~~](https://nginx.org/)  Well it's either NGINX or HAProxy or both. I keep experimenting so this list is bound to change from time to time.

  Updated: Currently I removed NGINX since I already have HAProxy to serve the app, NGINX seemed wasteful specially when I'm not utilizing any of it's capabilities.

  > If most of the site is served by Cloudflare and the revalidation is handled by HAProxy which is faster in this case because I'm only concerned about [L4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model) which HAProxy is miles ahead in this area compared to NGINX. Not gonna even dispute it. And this is coming from someone who puts NGINX on his best softwares he used.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) You kinda hate Docker but you want the benefits, you know? when something is useful but it does have the habit of being a weirdo and log some errors unrelated to anything raising your blood pressure. 

  Or one of my favorites: I declare that this image layer is not in the **build cache**, I am going to rebuild the whole thing now. 

  Please have a seat till rebuilding every image included in your build is done, then you can launch your **Dockerized app**!

  **Best regards, **

  **Docker buildx**

- [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) Takes care of delivering 99.9% of the app for a specified period of time that i can set. In fact it does so much stuff, to the degree that i believe their free plan is a steal. 

  Kudos to Cloudflare for having this amazing service. 

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Well, why not?

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 🤔

- [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) Since we're building a minimal app and not over engineering stuff 👆, MDX seemed like a good choice here (don't believe what I say, I didn't even know what MDX was).

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) Honestly I just saw this [guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy1H38XrN7hi7wHSClfXPqQ) just adding class names to stuff and every thing worked perfectly, so I knew it would be a perfect fit. 

  Sadly I'm not that guy so I suffered trying to.... uhhh, you know the **CSS** stuff where you put font-size and hope it works on mobile too, and why the hell this **H1** is BIGGER than everything???

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)  Used as a staging server. It's perfect since you know Vercel will always output the correct result. Whether it's about what's rendered, caching or performance, also it's nice to mimic their approach, a good learning experience. 

## FAQ

- Yes I know I don't need any of this
- Indeed this is overkill
- No this is not a waste of time, I learn by doing and I treat this site as a playground
- No, it didn't take me a lot of time setting up those, I do these on daily basis
- Nope, I'm still bad using **CSS**
- No those are not dependencies, You can clone or fork the repository and deploy it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- After the end result, I learned some things regarding both Front-end and Back-end. I might write something about it later with more details

## Coding and best practices

This project is by no means represents a good example of how to build an app. Honestly, I didn't even think I would finish it but here we are. You won't find much in the code. 

However if you are like me, then maybe you could benefit from some gotchas that prevent you from wasting time.

This is my way of learning things. I read, develop then start progressing in a form of trial and error. Then iterate and fix, honestly I didn't know that I would enjoy it so much eventually it would eventually becomes a real thing.

With time, the code should be cleaner by removing some technical debts or using the proper way to implement something. 

If you wanna contribute, fix stuff, or whatever feel free to do so. The code is open sourced on GitHub.

## Lessons learned

- Stop wasting your time for a month in a [lab](https://rsms.me/inter/lab/) just to get the perfect thing, nothing is perfect (Not really, I didn't learn this lesson and I am still in the lab)
- Iterate and enhance as you go, don't redo everything from scratch after the first failure
- No knowledge is irrelevant or a waste of time. As I said before this helped me a lot dealing with software on the other side of the spectrum
- Wanna do something? do it! stop thinking about the perfect execution. When was the last time you did something totally new and it was perfect on the first try?
- Don't be like me

## Acknowledgment

I used a lot of things from these resources, sometimes copy pasta of some component design, maybe just some helpers code snippets, or simply by looking at the way things are handled. 

In the end the app deviated from those due to the rapid learning curve I gained while developing.

- [Timothy Lin](https://tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.vercel.app/)
- [Jamify.org](https://www.jamify.org/)
- [Omar Alsoudani](https://mkreg.dev/)

What? of course I included my self, otherwise who do you think will do all the copy pasta or even write this post??

> Serious talk, I don't copy paste anything that I don't or won't fully understand and neither should you. (unless it's **PHP** mixed with **regex**, then go ahead my friend copy pasta the whole thing and don't look back)

## Infrastructure

I won't be discussing the infrastructure in this post due to a large amount of information, I might split that into a series of articles. 

I am still figuring out how to structure the content, however the tools mentioned above is just running on a **$6 VPS**, if you wanna learn more about it, feel free to contact me.

## What's next

I will keep iterating and enhancing the app, code-wise, **UI/UX** (yeah right...), tooling and content.

If you have some suggestions then contact me!
