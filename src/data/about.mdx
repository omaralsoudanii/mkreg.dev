I'm a Software Engineer based in Amman, Jordan â€“ I've been building stuff on the web for about 7 years or so. I stopped counting after a while â€“ working with companies across various countries and industries, my focus would be on building **cloud-agnostic** â€“ **scalable** and **performant** applications.

The knowledge from learning new programming languages and frameworks became less and less valuable to me over time â€“ of course programming languages with different paradigm is always beneficial (**Functional** & **Imperative**) â€“ even if I don't use it directly it's gonna broaden my problem solving capabilities with new ideas and possibly a different approach. 

In summary, The software and tech I use is a tool to solve a problem. Understanding the problem and identifying the core cause is much more crucial, specially early in developing a new product. 

> I believe dealing with problems at the product core, whether it's in infrastructure or crucial low level API which you simply can't just change without a refactor is the hardest to solve. Sometimes refactor is indeed the best solution and the worst solution at the same time

I wrote more  specific article about software and tech I use, you can read it at my [Stack](/writing/stack)

## Trivia

It's a known fact that my UI/UX  knowledge is worse than **NVIDIA** drivers support for Linux.

> Sure thing boss! I can integrate that API for you.... Oh, you wanna know the best way to announce our new integration feature to the users?! 
>
> Hmm let's see, probably besides the app logo with small text like "Check out our new feature" and an arrow pointing to the right side? or maybe with a hand emoji ðŸ‘‰ ?
>
> Huh, you think it's terrible? well that's your opinion, personally I think it looks fantastic. Don't worry not every one has impeccable taste when designing the UI/UX, for me I believe it's pure talent.

Now seriously, I am not even sure if this looks okay or just ugly â€“ maybe something else only a picture can describe â€“ this site is copied by other **open-sourced** projects. 

Hold on... (did I just said **copied**??) nah that was a typo, I MEANT **inspired** not copied â€“ the site is **open-sourced** in case you are **inspired**, read more about it at [Building my site](/writing/building-my-site)
