I'm a **Software Engineer** based in Amman, Jordan. I've been building stuff on the web for about 7 years or so, I stopped counting after a while. Working with companies across various countries and industries, my focus would be on building **cloud-agnostic**, **scalable** and **performant** applications.

The knowledge from learning new programming languages and frameworks became less and less valuable to me over time. Of course programming languages with different paradigm is always beneficial (**Functional** & **Imperative**). Even if I don't use it directly it's gonna broaden my problem solving capabilities with new ideas and possibly a different approach. 

In summary, The software and tech I use is a tool to solve a problem. Understanding the problem and identifying the core cause is much more crucial, specially early in developing a new product. 

> I believe dealing with problems at the product core, whether it's in infrastructure or crucial low level API which you simply can't just change without a refactor is the hardest to solve. Sometimes refactor is indeed the best solution and the worst solution at the same time

I wrote more  specific article about software and tech I use, you can read it at my [Stack](/writing/stack)

## Sad Fact

I don't know any **CSS** or **Flexbox** or anything about **UI/UX**, please keep in mind that it only took me a whole week to center a paragraph in a page, didn't even work on mobile ðŸ¤¦. It's a fact is that my **Front-end** skills in **UI/UX** are kinda worse than **NVIDIA** drivers support for Linux. 

> Sure I can integrate that API for you. Oh, you wanna know the best way to announce our new integration feature to the users?! hmmm let's see. Probably besides the app logo with small text like "Check out our new feature" and an arrow pointing to the right side? or maybe with a hand emoji ðŸ‘‰?

Now seriously, I am not even sure if this looks **okay** or **just ugly**, maybe something else only a picture can describe. This site is copied by other **open-source** projects. Hold on (did I just said **copied??**) Hah that was a typo, I **MEANT** **inspired** not **copied**, apologies for the typo.

The site is **open-sourced** in case you are **inspired**, read more about it at [Building my site](/writing/building-my-site)
