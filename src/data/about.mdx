I'm a **Software Engineer** based in Amman, Jordan. I've been building stuff on the web for about 7 years or so, I stopped counting after a while. Working with companies across various countries and industries, my focus would be on building cloud-agnostic, scalable and performant applications.

The knowledge from learning new programming languages and frameworks became less valuable to me over the years, of course programming languages with different paradigm is always beneficial, even if I don't use it directly, I will make my problem solving capabilities broader with new ideas. 

I developed a mindset that the tooling we use won't matter after a certain point, for ecosystems in a similar fields, I can be up and running in less than a month, and I will learn any specific details by trial and error. What actually matters is the fundamentals that powers our current software ecosystem. Most of the technologies have similar patterns and a way of developing software.

What I do best is to recognize these challenges and patterns during the life cycle of developing software. Anticipate future issues, evaluate if the cost of developing new feature is worth it to business. Finally, implementing the software based on the mentioned factors.

To summarize, the technologies and tooling I will use is a tool to solve a specific problem. Understanding the problem and identifying the core cause is much more important. I wrote more tech specific article about software and tooling I use, you can read it here at my [Stack](/writing/stack)

## My Goal

I want this site to be my digital identity, where I can write notes. Share my knowledge with others, my opinion on some topics, and open-source projects I create and share them here. Maybe with a playground or proof of concept. 

## Trivia

I don't know any **CSS** or **Flexbox** or anything about **UI/UX**, please keep in mind that it only took me a whole week to center a paragraph in a page, didn't even work on mobile ðŸ¤¦. So, let's just accept the fact that my **Front-end** skills are kinda worse than **NVIDIA** drivers support for Linux.

On a serious note, I simply don't have the talent for **UI/UX**, neither the experience on how to create eye-pleasing applications. However, I have a lot of knowledge when it comes to non **UI/UX** parts.

I am not even sure if this looks okay or just ugly or something else, this site is **copied** by other open-source projects. Hold on, I **MEANT** inspired not copied, apologies for the typo. Read more about it here at [Building my site](/writing/building-my-site)
