**1949** Mark is born in Glasgow, to an English mother and Hungarian émigré father.

**1955** At six, he hears Lonnie Donegan, and the music bug bites him hard.

**1956** Mark and family move to his mother’s home town, Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

**1960** Further musical inspiration comes from his uncle Kingsley, who plays harmonica and boogie-woogie piano, and Hank Marvin, when Mark hears the Shadows’ “Apache.”

**1962-63** Entering his teens, he stops to gape in a Newcastle guitar shop window at a red Fender Stratocaster. He becomes more interested in mimicking ‘Wipeout’ runs on his school desktop than in his studies, and persuades his father to spend £50 on his first guitar, a twin pick-up Höfner V2. It’s cheap, but it’s red.

**1964** Knopfler starts going to gigs at Newcastle City Hall, seeing Chuck Berry, among other visiting artists, and his first British rock star, Joe Brown. Meanwhile, he starts playing in local beat bands, hoping to replicate the licks of heroes like Marvin, Duane Eddy, Chet Atkins, Django Reinhardt and Lonnie Johnson.

**1965** Aged 16, he forms a folk duo with his school friend Sue Hercombe, and they make it onto a local television report.

**1967** Mark studies journalism for a year at Harlow College.

**1968** He is hired as a junior reporter on the _Yorkshire Evening Post_. On an early assignment, he accompanies journalist Stephen Phillips when he interviews a local musician making good in the Leeds area, coincidentally also called Stephen Phillips. The two guitar nuts become fast friends; some 22 years later, they are fellow members of the country rock spinoff group the Notting Hillbillies.

**1970** Mark starts an English degree at Leeds University, the same year he records a demo of an early composition, “Summer’s Coming My Way,” with Phillips and other friends. During his time at Leeds University, Mark and Steve Phillips form the _Duolian String-Pickers_.

**1973** Knopfler graduates from university and decides to try his luck in the London music scene, briefly joining the band Brewers Droop, who include drummer Pick Withers. Mark lectures at Loughton College in Essex.

**1975** Knopfler is focusing on the band Café Racers, as his brother David moves to London. The group’s ranks are later extended with the addition of David’s flatmate, Leicester-born bassist John Illsley.

**1977** A pivotal year, in which Mark moves in with David and John and they start recording Mark’s songs. As his dexterity as a writer-guitarist become ever more obvious, they become a quartet with the addition of Withers, change their name to Dire Straits and record the famed demos that are played on BBC Radio London by author and broadcaster Charlie Gillett. A deal with Phonogram’s Vertigo label ensues, as do early Dire Straits club gigs.

**1978** They support Talking Heads, then the Climax Blues Band, and play their first headline tour. “Sultans Of Swing” is released as a UK single. Despite critical acclaim, it misses the charts, but the band’s self-titled debut album charts in July, initially reaching No. 38. Sellout dates in Germany, Holland and Belgium follow in the autumn, as the album becomes a big success in Australia and New Zealand.

**1979** _Dire Straits_, produced by Muff Winwood, debuts on the US album chart in January, and the band back it with a huge American tour. Bob Dylan comes to see them in Los Angeles, and the album peaks at No. 2 in the US, eventually going double platinum, with two Grammy nominations. “Sultans” hits No. 4 on the Hot 100, and on its UK reissue, No. 8 there. _Dire Straits_ rebounds to No. 5 in Britain. The second album _Communique_ follows in June, produced by Muscle Shoals notable Barry Beckett and the legendary Jerry Wexler.

**1980** Third album _Making Movies_ released, a double platinum seller in the UK and No. 1 in parts of Europe. David Knopfler leaves during its recording, with English keyboard player Alan Clark and Californian guitarist Hal Lindes joining for subsequent tour dates. Mark’s, and the band’s, creative reach extends ever further, notably with the 1981 British top ten hit “Romeo and Juliet”.

**1982** _Love Over Gold_ becomes Dire Straits’ first UK No. 1 album. Knopfler’s songwriting skills reach new levels of sophistication well beyond the confines of the three-minute single, particularly on the 14-minute opener “Telegraph Road” and the equally atmospheric UK No. 2 single “Private Investigations”.

**1983** An eight-month world tour leads to the following year’s live album _Alchemy_; Knopfler co-produces Bob Dylan’s _Infidels_ and writes and records his first film score, _Local Hero_ (from which the sax-led “Going Home” continues to play as Newcastle United FC take to the pitch).

**1984** The films _Cal_ and _Comfort and Joy_ are released with Knopfler scores, as he also produces _The Knife_ for Scottish modern rock pacesetters Aztec Camera.  On top of this he writes “Private Dancer”, the title track to Tina Turner’s most successful album.

**1985** The year of the record-breaking _Brothers In Arms_. A global No. 1 and double Grammy winner, it contains the US chart-topper “Money For Nothing” and sells an estimated 30 million copies worldwide, also becoming the first million-selling compact disc. The ensuing world tour runs to almost 250 shows, during which the band also star at Live Aid.

**1987** Knopfler completes his next soundtrack, for _Princess Bride_, and produces former Mink DeVille frontman Willy Deville’s _Miracle_ album.

**1988** Another prestigious studio credit, as he co-produces Randy Newman’s lauded _Land Of Dreams_.

**1989** _Last Exit To Brooklyn_ film soundtrack.

**1990** The aforementioned Notting Hillbillies release the one-off _Missing… Presumed Having A Good Time_, and Mark collaborates with longtime hero Chet Atkins on the _Neck and Neck_ album.

**1991** _On Every Street_ becomes the final Dire Straits studio album, topping the charts in the UK, Australia and throughout Europe.

**1996** Another highly significant year, as Knopfler releases his first non-soundtrack album in his own name, _Golden Heart_, from which “Darling Pretty” is a UK top 40 single.

**1999** Knopfler is awarded the OBE.

**2000** After further soundtrack work on _Wag The Dog_ (1998) and _Metroland_ (1999), a second solo set follows, _Sailing To Philadelphia_, featuring guest appearances by James Taylor and Van Morrison. The album sells two million copies across Europe.

**2002** As his work reflects ever more evidence of his folk and acoustic leanings, _The Ragpicker’s Dream_ is released, featuring the single “Why Aye Man.” Another movie score, for _A Shot At Glory_, arrives the same year.

**2004** Now on a highly productive and creative roll, and working with hand-picked, A-list musicians including his constant collaborator, keyboard player and engineer Guy Fletcher, Knopfler releases the _Shangri-La_ album, followed as usual by an extensive worldwide tour of 100-plus shows.

**2006** The fruition of a longtime ambition, a collaborative album with his friend and country music heroine Emmylou Harris. _All The Roadrunning_ is followed by a 23-city tour of Europe and North America and the _Real Live Roadrunning_ album. The same year, Razorlight’s self-titled, chart-topping second album is recorded at British Grove, the west London studio Knopfler has opened, where records will be made by Travis, Duffy and many others.

**2007** _Kill To Get Crimson_ is the first of Knopfler’s own albums to be recorded at British Grove. He follows it with a 94-date world tour.

**2009** _Get Lucky_ becomes a top three album throughout much of Europe, supported by another huge international tour the following year. British Grove wins the Music Producers Guild award for Best Studio.

**2011** Knopfler plays a European tour of 30-plus dates in the autumn with his old friend Bob Dylan, repeating the feat in North America a year later.

**2012** After producing Irish roots-rock artist Bap Kennedy’s _The Sailor’s Revenge_ record, Knopfler releases his first studio double album, _Privateering_, which takes up its customary top ten berth in the UK and Europe. He wins an Ivor Novello Lifetime Achievement Award.

**2013** A 70-date tour of Europe follows, including his customary six sellout nights at the Royal Albert Hall.

**2015** Knopfler releases his eighth non-soundtrack solo album _Tracker_; works on his next film soundtrack for director Hugh Hudson’s _Altamira_; and prepares for another major world tour starting in May.

**2016** In November, Gibson announce the Custom Shop Mark Knopfler 1958 Les Paul. Mark hand-signs and numbers the fifty VOS aged models on the back of the headstock.

**2017** Mark unveiled one of two London buses used to promote International Busking Day, 22nd July.

**2018** Dire Straits inducted into the Rock ‘N Roll Hall of Fame. Mark releases ninth solo studio album, Down The Road Wherever, and announces European and North American tour for 2019. He is awarded the Living Legends Award and performs at the Scottish Music Awards.

**2019** The _Local Hero_ stage adaptation premieres in Edinburgh at the Lyceum Theatre for a successful 6 week run, and a season at The Old Vic in London in announced for 2020. The _Down The Road Wherever_ tour begins in April for 86 dates, culminating with the final show at Madison Square Garden in New York, with special guest Bonnie Raitt.
