## Guy Fletcher: Keyboards & Musical Director 

Guy has worked on stage and in studio with many world renowned artists such as Cockney Rebel, Tina Turner, Randy Newman, Dire Straits, Mick Jagger, Difford/Tillbrook, Roxy Music, Bill Wyman and Vicente Amigo as keyboard player, arranger and Musical Director. Yet it is with Mark Knopfler that Guy has been most involved, in particular as Producer and Engineer for Mark's recent solo albums, film and musical projects. 

Mark first met Guy in 1983, when Guy knocked on Mark's door with a synthesiser under his arm. Guy's technical and musical abilities became essential to Mark, and the pair immediately started work on two film soundtracks, Cal and Comfort and Joy. It was a natural progression that Guy would join Mark's band, Dire Straits. 

Guy's solo projects are all available on his website www.guyfletcher.co.uk, which continues to host the ever popular diaries from tour and studio since 2001\. 

## Danny Cummings: Percussion 

Danny Cummings was born in Sheffield in 1957, where he lived in the district of Pitsmoor. Throughout his childhood and adolescence he was captivated by the music of the sixties. 'Every generation will experience a revolution of some kind and as I grew up, it was youth culture, art and fashion, united in rebellion!' 

He internalised the music of the time. Meanwhile his dad Bill, who was an operatic tenor, also worked in different spheres of the music world.  
Danny witnessed much of this. Aged 4, Danny remembers listening to Bob Dylan and The Beach Boys, with those wonderful harmonies played loudly at neighbour John Gilling's house. 'Nothing else could ever reach me in quite that way and I knew it'. 

Later came his own personal rebellion. "What...you want to play Conga?" "Oh you bet!"  
Danny continued following his passion as a professional, which led him to play in diverse genres for many high profile artists and bands. Having played previously for Dire Straits and Mark Knopfler, he's back once more; this time playing percussion on Mark's latest Down The Road Wherever album and tour.

## Richard Bennett: Guitar

Richard has played with and/or handled production chores for Beatle Ringo Starr, and the man responsible for the skiffle craze in England that inspired the Beatles (and most of the greatest British groups who burst upon the 60s pop scene) to pick up guitars in the first place -- Lonnie Donegan. He's performed or recorded with some of the very founders and pioneers of rock and roll -- Brenda Lee, Gene Vincent, an Everly Brother or two, and put his skills to work in service of some of the greatest pop singers ever -- Andy Williams, Vicki Carr, Sammy Davis Jr, Peggy Lee and Johnny Mathis. 

Richard's new solo album, Ballads In Otherness was released in 2018. Please visit www.richard-bennett.com for more information, full biography, discography, photos, tour diaries and more
