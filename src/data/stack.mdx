My collection of **technologies** and **tools** from **programming languages** to **editors** and more. Most of these have grown over the years I've started programming. Some of them I consider my self well-versed, others capable enough to be up and running in short time.

Naturally this page will be updated frequently with the latest tech and tools.

## Stuff for developing

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the main editor. [Vim](https://github.com/omaralsoudanii/vimrc/) when I can, config is a fork from [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc/) with minor tweaks like deleting plugins I don't need and theming adjustments

  Sometimes I use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) when I wanna work on a **language**, actually I'll let that up to you to guess WHAT language is locked to using an **IDE** that decides to reserve 20GB of RAM while editing a small program.
  
- Whatever Terminal comes with the distro I have, currently **GNOME** Terminal with customized colors using [terminal.sexy](https://terminal.sexy). Although when I had **KDE**. I loved **Konsole**
  
- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/)
  
- [Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/)
  
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) for coding stuff, [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) for reading
  
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) (The old design, I'll just stop visiting if they remove it) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). Browsing those sites is a sign that I have some chore work to do, or stuck on something stupid

## Workstation

An ancient desktop PC that you don't even wanna know about (Yes I do whine when Electron eats my RAM for lunch).

It's not that bad, here's the specs according to **neofetch**:

- M.2 NVMe SSD
- 40 GB RAM (I guess it's **2400MHz**)
- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070. Hold your thoughts, this is running on [Linux](https://mkreg.dev/static/images/writing/stack/linus-torvalds-middle-finger.jpg) OS
- Intel i7-6700 (8) @ **4.000GHz**. Not sure what the hell is this but I know it's old and probably the bottle neck (and the bloated software we use daily)
- Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS
- The worst screen ever created the mighty **ASUS VG248QE**
- A motherboard
