        <p>
          Iâ€™m Omar Alsoudani, a software engineer, based in Amman, Jordan. I've
          been building stuff on the web for about 7 years or so (I stopped
          counting after a while). Working with companies across various
          countries and industries. My focus would be on building
          cloud-agnostic, scalable and performant applications.
        </p>
        <h2>Technical point of view</h2>
        <p>
          I have stopped counting what programming languages I know or what
          frameworks I can work with. I developed a mindset that the tooling we
          use won't matter after a certain point, what will always matter is the
          fundamentals that powers our current software ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I do best is to recognize the challenges and patterns that arise
          during the life cycle of developing software, whether it's about
          business, technical debt and you probably know the rest. My approach
          to get a solution would be pragmatic depending on many factors I
          gained throughout the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          In short, the technology you are gonna use is a tool to solve the
          problem. Understanding the problem and identifying the core cause is
          more valuable for me. You can find what I "think" am capable of in my{' '}

        <h2>Note</h2>
        <p>
          I don't know CSS or Flexbox or anything about UI, please keep in mind
          that it only took me a whole week to center a paragraph in a page
          (didn't even work on mobile ðŸ¤¦). So, let's just accept the fact that
          my Frontend skills are kinda worse than NVIDIA drivers support for
          Linux.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a serious note, I simply don't have the talent for UI/UX, neither
          the experience on how to create eye-pleasing applications. However, I
          have a lot of knowledge when it comes to non UI parts.
